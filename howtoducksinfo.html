        <div class=introInside>
            <p>
               During the third round of expeditions here at Summit Shasta 
               we had to make an interactive web page that solved some sort 
               of problem, let that be big or small or goofy. I personally 
               decided to use the same love of ducks that inspired my java 
               script duck that ate bread, and expand on that and use that 
               to make something new that would help users decide what to 
               feed ducks. I did research to decide how each different type 
               of duck would react to being fed the different food options 
               by the user. The page uses the html to create buttons and 
               selectors and divs that have an id. Using this id I was able 
               to move it over to my linked javascript page and change the 
               styles and properties of the element using the DOM, (Document 
               Object Model). My page specifically relies on “getElementById”,  
               “if” statements, “addEventListener”, and changing the “innerHTML” 
               to make a website that essentially makes different images of 
               ducks appear based on which breed of duck the user decides to 
               spawn and what the user decided to feed the duck. In my website 
               the user is given the choices of “Mallard” “Domestic” “Marbled” 
               and “Goose??” that each make a different image that I drew 
               myself appear.

        <!--first paragrpsh about what getElementById is in my code-->
        <div class=elementInside>
            <p>
               In my web page “getElementById” is mainly important for creating 
               each part of my webpage. The buttons and the selectors and the text 
               that shows up on my page is all originally created to store the 
               values of the elements in my html. By creating the basic form of 
               these elements it allows me to easily link it in my javascript to 
               more easily change the properties of the action items. Being able 
               to link the html to javascript allows me to use things like 
               “addEventListener” and change how they react to the user’s actions. 
               The picture on the top left is what I typed into the html document to 
               make the buttons and selector on my webpage. 
                <br>
                <br>
        <!--second paragrpah that ties in innerhtml a little bit and talks more about ids-->
                “getElementById” also affected the divs and the text that appeared 
                in my html. This ties into “innerHTML” but essentially, “getElementById” 
                is written “document.getElementById” which means that in my website 
                the program goes through the HTML document looking for the id that I 
                called in the javascript page and it can link it, just like the other 
                elements, allowing it to change the properties of the text and in my 
                case it would be helpful for making a different image pop up for each thing.

            <p>
                This piece of code is the most important for making my code work. 
                The “addEventListener” would use an id that I previously set in the 
                html. To make my “Duck Be Born” button to work, for example, I would 
                use and “addEventListener” and using the format seen in the image below, 
                it would mean that every time the user clicked the button it would 
                take this command and change whatever kind of style I would want the 
                button to do.

            <!--second paragraph that explains my hardship of addEventListener-->
                In my duck be Born event listener I then used the if else statements to create 
                a situation similar to when I coded a calculator. Each different selection for 
                my kind of ducks would change which image appeared when the user clicked the 
                “Duck Be Born” button. This is where I remember running into trouble. It made 
                me realize a very important part of this selection I had to make.

                so it is easier to change and control each part of the event listener. This little 
                piece of code is essentially saying, the variable of “tod” is equal to “typeOfDuck

               If else statements are used after “addEventListener” and is inside of 
               the “click” function in my code. These are basically what allows my 
               javascript to tell what duck the user selected and which food button 
               the user clicked as well. I used if else statements in my previous 
               project last expeditions interval to make my duck eat be able to fly 
               and swim on certain part of the page. This “if and “else if” statements 
               in this project are a lot more important because my overall code would 
               not be able to  work if the “if” and “else if statements did not 
               function properly because it is necessary in order for the code to 
               be able to find which image and text to give the user each time they click.

        <!--second paragraph about the real infor on how "if" and "if else" work -->
            <p>
               <br>
                The “if” an “else if” statements essentially took the “tod” variable, 
                which I got from the “.value” of “typeOfDuck”, and assessed that user 
                inputted value to go down the line of “else if” statements and decide 
                which one would be used. For example, if the user selected no duck at 
                all and left it blank but clicked the button “Duck Be Born” my 
                conditionals would create an alert that told them them needed to input 
                a duck before pushing the button that made it appear. When the user 
                selected a duck the conditional statement would pass by the first “if” 
                because it would not be true and it would travel down my code until it 
                found the statement to be true.

            <p>
                The innerHTML in my website takes the info from the divs “info” and 
                duck” to change each part to either the duck’s text reaction to the 
                food and the drawing reaction. In each event listener that listens for 
                the change of the user, in my case “click”, I put in innerHTML changes 
                that were the main parts of how I was able to change the image and the 
                text for each button that was pushed. In my code, Each button has both 
                the “info” and “duck” divs change each time for each input from the user. 
                In my code, the innerHTML basically replaces the automatic text that I put 
                in the HTML, which is “Find out what ducks feels about different foods!” 
                and puts in the text I changed in the java script each time the user 
                pushes a different button to feed the duck.

        <!--first paragraph that explains a big decision in my code journey these two weeks -->
                My biggest decision was how I would format the coding to make it easiest to 
                change to what I wanted it to be. Although, I later realized that I did not 
                choose the most effective way to make my code work, I did utilize all of the 
                different parts that I had learned to the best of my ability.

        <!--second paragraph that explains how much freedom I had in this project-->
                Other than that, I had a lot of freedom in my project. Being told that all my web 
                page needed to do was solve any problem created a wide window for me to be very creative. 
                At the same time I had to plan my decisions to make sure I was being really clear and 
                precise in my code. During this interval I used comments for almost every other line 
                in my code. I knew it would be easy to get lost in my code so I commented through the 
                whole thing to make it easier not only for myself but for whoever wants to look at my code.

              It was the same thing with the names for my ids and classes I created. If I had named 
              them all something like “duck” I wouldn't be sure which duck was which or which button 
              did which action. This project made me really realize how important it was to be 
              organized with naming things since each part looked basically the same.

            <p>
               Before coming into this project, if someone told me to make something that
               was interactive I would have made a book or something that the user could 
               actually touch. In that way this project changed my thinking. I created 
               something interactive that you don’t physically touch with your hands. 
               I know for sure before coming to this class I would not have been able 
               to create something digital that reacts to the user. This project allowed 
               me to tie together an activity that I love, drawing, with something 
               pretty new to me, coding.

        <!--second paragraph that explains what I would have done differently with more time-->
                The first thing that comes to mind when asked what I would do with more time for this project 
                is that I would want to create more duck options. 
                Maybe I could even make it better and make another change to the innerHTML 
                to make my interactive website show more facts about ducks and what is 
                healthy to feed them. Additionally, I would want to work on making it 
                more concise because I found myself repeating code under each button for 
                each if else statement and it got me thinking if there was a way that I 
                could change it to make it more concise so I wouldn’t have to type some 
                parts of code so many times. I also would have wanted to add different event 
                listeners to my code to make different things appear like if you hovered on 
                the duck it would react to the touch with a different image and different 
                text. Overall I would want to play with my website and add different elements 
                to make it even more interactive.
