            </h3>
            
            <p>
                During this two week project period I went through a journey making 
                many different web pages to build up the skill to code the page you're
                reading right now! I made this website to exhibit some skills I have learned
                so far in my computer science expedition. The project works by bringing
                together the different elements of basic HTML that is the backbone of the code 
                and CSS to create an interactive visual appealing experience for users.
                <br>
                <br>
                Not only did
                I have to learn certain tags, attributes and where to put them, but I also had to 
                make decisions on what I wanted my website to look based on the information I had 
                to incopirate. The pictures, headings, styles are just a
                few things I had to make decisions about. Before we get into the style of a website 
                let's first talk about the basic backbone for a website!

            <p>
                First I'll explain how to make headers and paragraphs to make basic
                HTML webpages. As you can see in the picture on the left, we start with 
                the tags &lt;h2&gt; and &lt;/h2&gt;. The h in these tags stands for header
                and has 6 different sizes. &lt;h1&gt; being the biggest header size and &lt;h6&gt; 
                being the smallest. the &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt; tags you see in the picture are
                the tags to write regularly in paragraph form.
                <br>
                <br>
                In my code for my "About Me" webpage, I chose to use &lt;h1&gt; for my big website title 
                that you see at the top of this page, &quot;About Me and What I Learned&quot;.  
                I used &lt;h2&gt; for my sections such as &quot;Who am I?&quot; and &quot;What
                I Did: Intro&quot;. Finally I used &lt;h3&gt; for the even smaller headings you 
                can see on this page such as &quot;Headers &amp; Paragraphs&quot;. It's important
                to note that headers come with a default font and to make the font your own you would
                need to edit it using style tags which I will talk about later.

            <h3>
                <u>Link Text & Images</u>
            </h3>
    
        <div class=container4>
            <p>
                Linking text for users to click on, and importing images, makes your website more lively
                and appealing to users. Let's start with link text. A link text are the words that show up 
                on a webpage for the user to click on. In order to create a link you have to remember the 
                tag for links is "a" and in order to get the link to work you need the attribute "href" which stands for
                hypertext refrence and defines the link address. So for example, in my website I linked my brother's 
                pixel art website usig "a href" so it would look like this since it has a link text of "his pixel art"
                : &lt;a href=&quot;http://rewa14.github.io/ipixelart/gallery.html&quot;&gt;his pixel art&lt;/a&gt;.
                This whole entire link element is called an anchor, which is a fancy name for the element that links to other pages.
                Looking at the screen shot below you can see what a linktext would look like on the webpage.<br>

                The picture below is an example of my code from my "Who am I?" page. This anchor has a link text of 
                "his pixel art" and links to my brother's pixel art website lipixel art. When making my 
                "About Me" page I chose to talk about my inspirations and why I'm taking this class. My brother is the
                main reason that I decided to try coding again and he is a really big role model for me. I chose to link his website because I want people who 
                look at my website to see the amazing skills of my brother who inspires me.

                To link pictures into your webpage you use the tag "img src" which stands for image source. In the screen shot of my code below,
                you can see I have a link to an image called "http://m.yh31.com/tp/su/201207252347592204.jpg". You can also see
                that I editied the style of the picture making the width 300px. It's important to know that you don't need a closing tag for the
                end of an image element, you only need to put a closing angle bracket as you can see in the screen shot of my code below.
                Pictures can add a lot of personality to your website so when choosing mine I tried to make them relevant but fun!<br>

                Divs (&lt;div&gt; and &lt;/div&gt;) are a nifty tag that allow the world of css to kind of open up and 
                for coders to be creative. Div stands for division and they are basically used to divide sections of code up for
                coders to group together and format in css. Div tags are special becuase they apply no meaning when just inputted into html. 
                Divs are very commenly used with the attribute "class" which basically allows coders to group the html together and know which parts are which.

                In my code below you can see I used the div contianer1 and container2 which I linked into my css page using a dot.
                underneath the container2 class you can see a bunch of different style tags. Border, padding, 
                margin, border-color, and background-color are all CSS attributes that I will explain later. the other attributes such as display, 
                width, and text-align are all used to make the pictures I linked in my website align to be next to my text.

                as the image. By doing that it made the block of the div inline with the image allowing it to be next to eachother. Divs are really important to my website and make a lot of my images and
                look the way they do. The reason I chose to design my page with some text and pictures next to eachother and some not in order to make my web
                page look organized and appealing to viewers. It depedned on what looked best with what size image I had and how much text.

        <h2>Style Tag and CSS</h2>
            
        <div class= container9> 
        <div class=container8>
            <p>
                CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet and it's basically what makes everything in your website look pretty. From  font, size, color, spacing, and border.
                When I went over divs, you may have noticed that a lot of the elements under the div tag in the CSS sheet were things like border. colors, and fonts. 
                When I designed my website I wanted to go with a purple and pink theme since I wanted to express who I was and those two colors are some of my favorite.
                looking at the div for container2 below, you can see there is a lot of different stylistic elements being added to the div. Remember, a div is like a group
                of code that makes it earier to style, so when styling my page, I made sure to keep a sort of frilly theme to match my background. Div container2 
                was a grouped HTML of all my text and pictures in the first part of my "About Me" page (not including the header). This means when I put something like 
                "background-color: rgba(204,204,255,0.2);" or  "border: dotted;" it means that everything around that picture and that paragraph will be in a border
                that has a dotted rim and the background for that border will be the color rgba(204,204,255,0.2); (a transparent white color). In fact 
                I chose to make the text border you are reading right now to match with the other webpage meaning the border is dotted and the background color for the border
                is rgba(204,204,255,0.2);.<br>

                There are some elements that you don't need to create classes for since they have their own tag that can group the HTML
                togther. As you can see in the screenshot below if you type in "body", the CSS page will group togther everything in the body section and it will be editied
                to be whatever style tags you put in that section (same applies with inputting things like headers and paragraphs into a CSS page).
                When I typed in "body" in my CSS page I was able to change the font for every thing I've written, (including the headers) and the color of the text 
                for every thing as well. But it doesn't stop there! Like I said before I chose to go with a pinkish purple theme so in order to make my whole
                website have a set wallpaper I put the attribute of "background-image" in the body to make sure all of it was the same.<br>

        <h2>My Take Away</h2>
    
    <div class=container11>
    <div class=container10>
        <p>
            During these past two weeks I've learned way more than I could have even imagined I would. I feel like there is so much more I can expand on
            in the future and it gets me excited thinking about what more I could possibly learn if these things are just the basics. Coming into this class
            with a negative experience with coding in the past, I feel like I've really grown to understand what makes coding so fun and worth while. There
            are so many amazing things I could take away from this experience but as far as one thing I'll make sure I won't forget when it comes to coding is 
            to not give up on yourself. I've had some frusterating times when a code just won't work even though it's right only to find out that I spelled container wrong.
            The feeling you get when your webpage is done and you can sit down and scroll through all the work you've done makes those small struggles worth while.<br>
            <hr color="lavender">
            But actually, one piece of html I'll make sure to remember for next time is the background image scroll and tab icon. These two things 
            I had to research on my own at home to fihure it out, and I'm really proud of. I was having trouble with the wallpaper since it wasn't long enough
            to reach to the bottom without getting cut off. I went home, researched and I was able to find an attribute called "background-attachment: fixed;"<br>
        <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Fot6TsIO2DxUe_aasJ-kdWoiHoNc98pe6Ug36D-w_25wECc1Ksj-Y_38nsT541N-BWbuBa_vGrRArMSPQzf4B5my8iRpemgC0n-uKrDGvByIS5skiJ3Fj5rONVofj5Ug9Nm--lEalI2nR6dwkhmbmHSEkD-mKysy_nRw3cY2rvCHGnJxssW9cD1CKxyiZSYPzBIqJjhyczUgFlmkulz3JfrVeGEVEMI6GotdCjw0CDrRVc_Dz4LWzmxb2SUgVUopt4xGlWMWZWTo6odRbVcWNNej3AnUFiVsBw0X7nhuzf-5tf0SXOAcQemL-RP2OajQHGkwnNSnhr-pHvBpjt4vbwwpqZAlGik-zUG470eiSE_ijQvMnibnqmLnf-_P6zFdZH4TXk4s4CdeFtcckg_TyNEH8klG1RxrlAMGONUNfDtoGSe8D6Ml7_OgFrtg-lQewn7CXxv9A1rFjeXuJrgJCk_JhKlIetxdsbUbpo4rUzLNo8FEgmw-oHac1NVC160gLhMh6VGpbv_BKBsQSZYaLPAXT_4J3pWaLk-eUcaOZHsapSzvgrrzQYnYLy6GDzyDjjH0qbdBLUJrh0l-KF7P4xtpJWfCfg5O3ils8WcqIiYfE6QzfmCL_V1Hng3HMbJZyVi2Yxh-x-Y7G0TNt5iBONbLOxmnlJMJzh0Y=w482-h128-no"

            when this is added to the body element in a CSS page it makes it so the wallpaper stays in one place while the text and everything else scrolls down.
            It gives it a really cool effect and I'm proud of my self for figuring it out and being able to teach it to others.<br>
            <hr color="lavender">
            The other piece of code I'll be sure not to forget is inputting a tab icon picture. This might not seem like somthing really important
            but It's special to me because I went out on my own and researched how to input one becasue I was so determinded to make my website look nice. If you look at the
            top of my tab you can see a little bear that I designed myslef. Using a website called <a href="http://www.favicon.cc/?action=logout">www.favicon.cc</a>
            I was able to draw my own favicon and link in in the head section of my HTML page. The icon was linked using the normal "a href" but there
            was a link tag in the beginning of the element. so it looked like this:<br>

        style="height:150px">
            <br>
            It's a pretty simple process but I want to make sure I don't forget becuase it's something I accomplished by myself and was also able to
            teach to other people.
