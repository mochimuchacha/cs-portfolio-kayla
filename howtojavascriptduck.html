                During the second block of expeditions for Computer Science
                We explored the world of JavaScript. Using codes like variables,
                loops, functions, and conditionals we were able to create an
                interactive world of color using the JavaScript language. During
                this class I created a cute duck made from ellipses that follows
                the user's mouse around the page and flies and swims in its lake.
                Additionally, if you click in the pond on top of the breadcrumb squares
                floating in it the little duck will take a bite! The more
                you click the more he eats. 
                <br>
                <br>
                This project works overall by using shapes
                such as ellipse and rect as well as the fill value to color
                them. The page uses loops to create the food in the pond, the
                clouds in the sky, and the redrawing of the duck taking a bite 
                so it overlaps the background. variables are used to create easy-access
                values that can be used over and over to be useful to
                the code. In this project, the function duckEats is used to make
                it possible for the duck to eat when the mouse clicks on the
                canvas. Conditionals could be considered the most important part of 
                this art piece as they allow the duck to be able to follow the
                accross the screen and fly when the duck goes up above the pond.

                In my piece of artwork, ellipses are a big part of my
                drawing. I started out drawing a bunch of simple ellipses
                changing the x, y, width, height. For example for the head of my duck 
                I used (255,250,70,70) to create a perfect circle for a head. (since the 
                width and height are the same numbers!)
                the rest of the duck is also made up of ellipses, even the wings!
                <br>
                <br>
                There are also other shapes that I used. for example the pond is 
                a rectangle, which in JavaScript is called using "rect". the land is
                also made up of a rectangle but is rounded because the last value was
                changed as seen in the picture on the bottom left.
                <br>
                <br>
                Another piece of simple code I used that was important was 
                the command "fill". This command allowed the whole world to turn to
                color and using any HTML color code you can think of controlling the
                red blue and green values.

                <u>Variables and For Loops</u>
            </h3>
            
        <div class=container6>
            
            <p>
                In my code, I used variables mainly with the 'for loops'.
                variables are known as a sort of named container to 
                make things easier when coding. 'For loops' use variables
                in their basic formation because for loops only loop 
                for a set amount of times based on the conditions.
                <br>
                <br>
                In my project, I mainly used 'for loops' in order to create the
                background and the bread crumbs floating in the water. 
                You'll notice the clouds and the bread are things that repeat.
                When I was coding I didn't want to draw the same shapes over
                and over again only to change the position a little bit. 'for loops'
                solve that problem! For example looking at the breadcrumbs in 
                my code, the m variable for the bread crumbs on the bottom are the 
                x value of the rectangle. This is because it allows the different
                conditions to change the ellipses, creating different positions and 
                styles. I changed the for loop's ending value that adds to the value
                in order to change the frequency of the breadcrumbs. (you can see
                this action in the gif below) when m+=200 changes to m+=100 the bread
                crumbs become more frequent. And when it becomes m+=10 the circles are
                so close that they look like a line!
            </p>

                Simply put functions are procedures used to make sure 
                actions are executed when needed in your code. In my project 
                I used functions to make it possible for my duck to eat the bread when
                the mouse was clicked. Using processing I used the mouseClicked function
                putting it into the format of:

                mouse and what allows it to fly when it's not swimming in its pond. 
                In my code, I used the position of my mouse Y coordinate in relation 
                to where the mouse was located on the canvas. For example, when my
                mouseY was less than 400 pixels across the screen it would mean that 
                my duck wouldn't be touching the pond water and would need his wings 
                to fly into the sky background.

                In the same "if" conditional I would also take the x and y values 
                of my shapes (in my case mostly ellipses) and <br> make them an even 
                value like 200 and however larger or smaller my x and y coordinates
                of my shape were <br> I would take "mouseX" or "mouseY" and add or subtract 
                however much it needed. this allowed my duck <br> drawing to follow the 
                points of my mouse because it considered them a coordinate.

               I think I'd really like to remember conditionals since it's favorite 
               piece of code and I feel like it was a big part that made my program 
               come to life. conditionals can change based on how the drawing overall 
               changes. It can change the color, shape, size, background and other 
               factors based solely on the position of the mouse or other factors 
               that change. For example in the conditional checkpoint for this project, 
               I created a small canvas that changed the shape color and shape based 
               on where you put your mouse. It seemed like such a cool thing and 
               learning how to really do it and understanding it like I felt I did 
               really help me with my project.
               <br>
               <br>
               conditionals start with the call "if" and can also use "else if" 
               and "else" to create more situations based on what is going on with 
               your code. In this example taken from my conditionals checkpoint, it 
               starts with an "if" and has the condition "(mouseX < 100)" and then 
               has a certain shape and color to change based on if the conditions 
               in the parenthesis are true or not. If they're not they move on the 
               next "else if" command and continues to change based on the factors 
               that change in the code block.

                In this coding adventure, I had a lot of decisions to make. I 
                basically had the freedom to design whatever I wanted as long 
                as it included the main pieces of code we were learning about. 
                My original idea was to just have a duck that somehow ate bread. 
                The reason I chose to make a duck is because I'm always talking 
                about ducks. Not only that but when I was really little my family 
                used to visit a cemetery to visit someone and we would always 
                stop and feed the ducks that lived in the pond. Having the chance 
                to make a fun interactive memory was really interesting and 
                challenging especially when the code didn't always work the way 
                you thought it would. I really had all kinds of choices from how 
                many pieces of code to use, to how I wanted the background and 
                colors to look. I never thought of coding as such an expressive 
                form of art and it was interesting to see how I could change one 
                small thing that would affect literally everything.

            <p>
                I feel like I could do sooooo much more if I had infinite time 
                honestly just off the top of my head <br> I would make the food rain 
                down from the sky or make it so there was a person in the background 
                that was <br> throwing the bread to the duck or maybe have something 
                when the duck ate a certain number of pieces <br> of bread it got a little 
                chubbier. The possibilities of using JavaScript to create art seems 
                endless. I would definitely <br> want to explore arrays a lot more and 
                see what other creations besides ducks I could forge up.
