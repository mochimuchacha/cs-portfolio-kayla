                My name is Kayla, also known as mochimuchacha on cloud9. I am a regular 
                Sophomore in highschool that enjoys activities like drawing and dancing 
                ballet. In my highschool, Summit Shasta we have classes called 
                expeditions where we can explore our passions or learn something new 
                outside of your comfort zone! For one of my classes I chose to explore 
                computer science since my brother who is in college really loves it and 
                took this same coding class. In this coding journey my brother has been 
                my main inspiration as he has created many impressive websites including 
                one where he shows off 
                <a href="http://rewa14.github.io/lipixelart/gallery.html">his pixel art</a>
                that he has created over the years.

                In my computer science expedition we started off with the basics of HTML
                and how to code basic things like headers and paragraphs. My website was
                blank and boring and very unappealing. As we dove further in the class
                we learned CSS and were able to bring color to the world! to the left
                is a picture of the website brought to life with color and borders.

                Not only has coding taught me the the clear cut tags, elements, functions, algorithms
                and attributes as well as how to aply them, it has also taught
                me patience and thinking skills.
                In about 6th grade my class participated in a coding class using
                a website called 
                <a href="https://code.org/">code.org</a>.
                although my classmates generlly enjoyed it I felt like I was not 
                challenging myself and was getting nothing out of typing some letters
                into a program. I became discouraged and convinced myself that this 
                was how all coding was and I told myself I didn't like it. Coming into
                this coding class I was very hesitant, but I wanted to try again and
                grow and expand my knowledge through something new.
                I'm glad that I came to this class because I have had a chance to expaned my patience, my creativity and
                my logical thinking skills in this class. I hope to learn so much more in the future!

<!--Section Four: JS Duck -->

            <div class= allWebOutside>

                <p>
                    For the second interval of coding class we made generative art websites. 
                    In my website I made a duck that followed the user's mouse and could eat bread 
                    crumbs that are on the surface of the water when the user clicked the mouse.
                    I used coding in java script to make it possible to draw shapes and have the
                    duck be able to eat the bread.This site is linked in my navagation bar above or you can find it 
                    <a href = "https://preview.c9users.io/mochimuchacha/cs-portfolio-kayla/duckeatingbread.html">here.</a>

                <p>
                    In the second interval of coding class we used java script again as well as some html 
                    components to make a website where the user has to interact with it somehow. I digitaly drew
                    different ducks so the user could feed the ducks I drew with buttons that make the text and duck 
                    appear with a new reaction each time. This site is also linked in my v=navigation car above but you can find 
                    it <a href = "https://preview.c9users.io/mochimuchacha/cs-portfolio-kayla/ducksinfo.html">here</a>

            <p>
                In the third and final interval of the coding expedition we used AI coding. We still honed
                in on the skills we had previosuly used but this time we used a game that was already made 
                and coded using tasks and fucntions that we already knew how to code. The game's users each code
                different things they want their character to do in order to help them win. The actual game can't be
                linked in my website but I explain more in detail how the code in my bot works on the page called 
                <a href = "https://preview.c9users.io/mochimuchacha/cs-portfolio-kayla/vindinium.html">"How to Vindinium"</a>.
